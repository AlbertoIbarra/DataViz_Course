### Melbourne Housing Market

#### Introduction

We are starting the year 2018. It is said that Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say that it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly, where should I buy a two-bedroom unit?
